    You look uncomfortable. Do you need any help?	 
    A human! Go away!	 
    Hey, calm down! I'm a forest ranger, I want to help every life in this forest.	 
    You are the new ranger? Great. This forest is not well maintained and I know a bunch of other animals suffer.	 
    Just follow me, I'll lead you out of the forest and take care of you. I'll search and help others later too!	 
    	 
    I'm so hungry, all insects are poisoned in this forest and I have no food to eat!	 
    Come with me! I'll get you some food! You can play with others in my place.	 
    Thanks! There are others who need help, please help them too!	 
    You look weak, are you ok?	 
    For sure! I'll save every life as I can!	 
    I can help you as I can fly. I can't lift you but am able to lift some other animals!	 
    That would be helpful!	 
    	 
    Help me! Oink oink! I got stuck!	 
    Sure! You seem to get hurt. Do you want to take a rest at my place and I can heal you?	 
    That would be great. I can destroy rocks if you need.	 
    	 
    The forest is one fire! Help there are some animals in it!	 
    Help there are some animals in it!	 
    Let's go!	 
    	 
    I want to find some honey to eat. Do you know where can I find some?	 
    This forest is getting barren. Come with me, I'll find some for you.	 
    Thanks. I'm good at staying in the air, if you throw me to a direction, I can stay there no matter how heavy you are.	 
    But you look so small!	 
    Try me!	 
    	 
    This is my place. Enjoy yourself, I'll go find others. I'll get back soon.	 
    	 
    Help! We have a friend falling into the mud!	 
    That's dangerous, let me help you!	 
    You get heavy and dragged into the mud if you touch it. let's link together and try not to fall into the mud yourself!	 
    	 
    I can't stop jumping!	 
    You look tired. I can try to find someone to help heal you.	 
    Thanks!
